## Overview

### The challenge

I wanted to create a music player that incorporated an image of a Boombox and perhaps some animation. While looking through stock images I found a beautiful poster design and set out to recreate it using divs and flexbox. This allowed me to add some cool animations which are triggered when the music plays. The radio section of the Boombox was the perfect place to incorporate a clickable progress bar.

## My process

### What I learned

I learned how to use the audio API as this is my first time using it and I found it very user friendly. I hope to work on some more audio related projects in the future. Although the Boombox is almost entirely constructed from circles and squares I created my first trapezoid using a clip path. 

### Continued development

I would like to learn more about the audio API. 

### Useful resources

- [Adobe Stock](https://stock.adobe.com/uk/contributor/206065386/thenatchdl?load_type=author&prev_url=detail) - This is the artist who designed the poster. They have many cool illustrations with a similar aesthetic.  
- [Clippy](https://bennettfeely.com/clippy/) - I used this tool to create my clipping path.
